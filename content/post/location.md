![Austin Jiu-Jitsu map](/img/map.png)

We're located in UT West Campus, 1 block east of Lamar on the northeast corner of Longview and 24th St in the 1st floor of the 24 Longview apartment building. In the Google Maps satellite image and street view, this shows up as an empty field. There is an apartment building there now. See the picture below.

### Parking

There is covered parking under the building (enter off the alleyway on the east side of the building). This entrance provides easier access to the gym and is recommended. There is another entrance off Longview on the west side of the building, but it's harder to get in the building from that side. Please park in spots designated as reserved for retail use.
