### Our Goal

We seek to teach general physical preparation primarily through bodyweight strength training techniques and progressions. We pursue strength with patience, diligence, and discipline. We use tried and true tools and focus extensively upon basic, foundational positioning before incrementally adding intensity and volume. You will work hard, and you will get Stronger, but you will not be asked to end every session in a puddle on the floor. Lessons aim to have you feeling fresher, stronger, and moving better than at the start, because you have other important things to do the rest of the day.

- We build Bodily Integrity and Dependable Strength
- Emphasis is placed thoroughly on quality over quantity.
- Sessions are lessons in proper technique, not just workouts.
- Gain foundational, non-specialized, full body strength.
- Learn Body-Weight exercises you can take anywhere.
- Build strong shoulders, hips and a stable mid-section to withstand the rigors of athletic training and every day life.

This is a program for everyday ladies and gentlemen who want to become Hard Ladies and Gentlemen without compromising their other athletic endeavors or their health through overtraining or training on top of dysfunction.

#### Private Lessons

Private Sessions include both gymnastic style bodyweight training and kettlebell lessons. Kettlebells build a rugged, all-terrain strength. When properly conducted, basic kettlebell exercises act both as a potent full-body strength tool and also a powerful therapeutic modality for rebuilding joints and alleviating lower back pain from poor mechanics. Because of space considerations and the care necessary to teach proper mechanics, kettlebell classes will not be hosted at this time. Small group lessons can be scheduled.
